# ConFo

A conversational form application that allows admins to create forms and displayes them in a chat interface format for a human-interaction-like form-filling experience.

## Users

The project aims to cater to two types of users
1. Admin - The user of our application who creates a form to be filled by the end users. Information like form fields, data types, etc have to be mentioned by the admin.
2. User - The end user who fills out the forms created by the admins through our platform. The form is a chat interface which gives a feel of talking to an actual person than filling out a conventional form.

## Flow and screenshots

### Home page
The admin signs up on the platform and sees the this screen. They can either create forms from here or view responses of their existing forms.

### Creating a form
The admin can create a form by providing a name and description to the form along with choosing a theme from the preset theme options.
