# ConFo

A conversational form application that allows admins to create forms and displayes them in a chat interface format for a human-interaction-like form-filling experience.

## Users

The project aims to cater to two types of users
1. Admin - The user of our application who creates a form to be filled by the end users. Information like form fields, data types, etc have to be mentioned by the admin.
2. User - The end user who fills out the forms created by the admins through our platform. The form is a chat interface which gives a feel of talking to an actual person thawn filling out a conventional form.
